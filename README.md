# Linked Data Community Place

Hello, and welcome! This is a starting point for a cross government Linked Data Community. 
A place where we can learn from each other about the history of linked data use in Civil Service,
but also where we will together explore the future. 

If you want to know more, if you want to get involved, please contact [Michał Poręba at Trade](mailto://michal.poreba@trade.gov.uk).

## Linked Data

What is linked data? Here are a few definitions to start us off: 

> In computing, linked data is structured data which is interlinked with other data 
> so it becomes more useful through semantic queries.
>
> -- *Wikipedia*

&nbsp;
> The Semantic Web isn't just about putting data on the web. 
> It is about making links, so that a person or machine can 
> explore the web of data. [...] 
> Linked Data lies at the heart of what Semantic Web is all about: 
> large scale integration of, and reasoning on, data on the Web
> 
> -- *World Wide Web Consortium*

&nbsp;
> Linked Data is a set of design principles for sharing machine-readable interlinked data 
> on the Web and Open Data can be freely used and distributed. 
> When combined with Open Data (data that can be freely used and distributed), it is called Linked Open Data (LOD)
>
> -- *Ontotext*

&nbsp;
> Linked data is a set of design principles for sharing machine-readable
> data on the Web for use by public administrations, business and citizens.
> 
> -- *EC ISA Case Study: How Linked Data is transforming eGovernment*

&nbsp;
> Linked Data is about communities agreeing on the meaning of their data 
> and sharing it in a massively networked information space. This vision is taking shape in many sectors, 
> including e-commerce, medicine, scientific research, and government services.

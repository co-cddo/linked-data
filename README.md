# Linked Data Community Place

Hello, and welcome! This is a starting point for a cross government Linked Data Community. 
A place where we can learn from each other about the history of linked data use in Civil Service,
but also where we will together explore the future. 

If you want to know more, if you want to get involved, please contact [Michał Poręba at Trade](mailto://michal.poreba@trade.gov.uk).
